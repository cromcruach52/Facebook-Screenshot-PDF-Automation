# Facebook Screenshot PDF Generator

A Python tool that automatically organizes Facebook screenshots into professionally formatted PDF reports with AI-powered content analysis and context extraction.

## üöÄ Main Features

### **Intelligent Content Analysis**
- **OCR Text Extraction**: Automatically extracts text from screenshots using Tesseract OCR
- **AI-Powered Page Detection**: Uses local Mistral LLM to identify Facebook pages, groups, or individual posters
- **Smart Context Summarization**: Generates concise 3-sentence summaries including main content and commenter sentiment
- **Poster vs. Commenter Detection**: Distinguishes between original posters and commenters/reactions

### **Professional PDF Generation**
- **Date-Based Organization**: Automatically groups screenshots by date from filename timestamps
- **Dynamic Filename Generation**: Creates descriptive filenames like `LilibethLaygo - August 1 - August 26.pdf`
- **Responsive Layout**: Fits 3 images per page in landscape A4 format with proper aspect ratio preservation
- **Multi-Page Support**: Handles large collections with automatic pagination

### **Robust Text Processing**
- **Unicode Safety**: Handles special characters and emojis for PDF compatibility
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple layers of error handling for OCR and AI processing
- **Content Filtering**: Removes Facebook UI noise (timestamps, reactions, sponsored labels)

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Tesseract OCR installed
- Ollama running with Mistral model
- Facebook screenshots with timestamp naming format: `Screenshot_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-xxx`

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

```bash
pip install pillow pytesseract fpdf2 ollama
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Edit the config section in the script:

```python
user_name = "NickoLaygo"  # user name for PDF filename
images_folder = "screenshots"        # Your screenshot folder
images_per_page = 3                 # Images per PDF page
ollama_model = "mistral:latest"     # AI model for analysis
```

## üéØ Use Cases
